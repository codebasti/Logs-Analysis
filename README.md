# Logs Analysis Project
#### _by Sebastian PÃ¼tz_
This project contains a python programm, that creates requests to a PSQL-database and prints them into the console.

## Install and run

1. Install [VirtualBox](virtualbox.com)

2. Install [Vagrant](vagrantup.com)

3. Clone/Fork this repository, connect to vagrant and navigate into the shared
folger "vagrant"
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/codebasti/logs-analysis-project/
$ cd logs-analysis-project
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
$ cd /vagrant
```

4. Download this [Zip-File](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip)
and extract it. Take the file "newsdata.sql" and move it into your vagrant directory.
Run these commands to get the data in your local machine up and running:   
(Make sure, you are connected to the virtual machine with vagrant ssh and
inside our vagrant folder!)
```
$vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ psql -d news -f newsdata.sql
```

5. Now you have access to the whole setup, but the logan.py programm needs some views to work properly.
Continue with step 6.

6. To create the views, simply go into the database terminal by executing the
following commands:
```
psql -d news
```
**View 1 - Each articles' total views**  
(Keep in mind, that you should execute the following code as 1 line)
```
CREATE VIEW articleviews AS
SELECT articles.title, COUNT(log.path) AS sum, articles.author
FROM articles, log
WHERE log.path LIKE '%'||articles.slug
GROUP BY articles.title
ORDER BY sum DESC;
```
**View 2 - Each authors' total articleviews**  
(Keep in mind, that you should execute the following code as 1 line)
```
CREATE VIEW articleauthors AS
SELECT articleauthors.name, SUM(articleviews.sum)
FROM articleauthors JOIN articleviews
ON articleauthors.title = articleviews.title
GROUP BY articleauthors.name
ORDER BY sum DESC;
```
**View 3 - Days where more than 1% of requests lead to errors**  
(Keep in mind, that you should execute the following code as 1 line)
```
CREATE VIEW dailyrequests AS
SELECT date(log.time) AS log_day,
  COUNT (CASE WHEN status LIKE '%200 OK%' THEN 1 END) AS views,
  COUNT (CASE WHEN status LIKE '%404%' THEN 1 END) AS errors,
  COUNT (method) AS requests
FROM log
GROUP BY date(log.time)
ORDER BY log_day;
```
Quit the pSQL-Session with ```\q```
7. The installation and setup is done. Our python programm now has everything to work properly.   
Run:
```
python logan.py
```
The programm could need some time. The programm prints our "-----END-----" as soon as
it is finished.
